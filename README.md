# Interactive Map
Please revisit: https://yanchaomcp.github.io/interactive_map/ 

This repository contains interactive maps that demonstrate the research findings from the activity and parking model. The maps display both the estimation and simulation results, offering insights into various aspects of parking behavior and activity utilities.

### Included Maps:
1. **Estimation of Activity Utilities** – A detailed visualization of estimated activity utilities across different regions.
2. **Hourly Parking Activities with User Heterogeneity** – This map showcases hourly parking activities, highlighting variations based on user heterogeneity.
3. **Parking Accuracy for Each Region** – Represents the parking accuracy across regions, using mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) as the metric.
4. **Parking Accuracy for Each Group** – Displays parking accuracy by group, also measured by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
