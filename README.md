## Optimizing Vehicle Activity Patterns with Markov Decision Process Modeling
This project focuses on applying Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling to optimize vehicle activity patterns and behaviors. Key contributions of this research include:

### Data Retrieval and Processing: 
Retrieved and processed large-scale vehicle activity data from APIs to calibrate behavior models effectively.
### Dynamic Programming for Optimization: 
Implemented a dynamic programming-based approach to optimize parking activities, improving efficiency and utilization.
### Interactive Visualization: 
Developed interactive visualizations of the results using Python libraries such as Bokeh and Plotly, enabling intuitive data exploration and analysis.
