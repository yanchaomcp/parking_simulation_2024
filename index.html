    <!-- <h1>Welcome to the Bokeh Maps</h1> -->

    <p>Below are the interactive maps showing the model estimation and simulation results:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="res_visualization/interactive_map_utility.html">Map 1: Estimation of Activity Utilities</a> – A detailed visualization of estimated activity utilities across different regions, hours, and user groups. Use the drop-down menu to explore.</li>

        <li><a href="res_visualization/interactive_map_parking_simulation.html">Map 2: Hourly Parking Activities with User Heterogeneity</a> – Demonstrates hourly parking activities, highlighting variations based on user heterogeneity. Use both the slider and drop-down menu to explore.</li>

        <li><a href="res_visualization/interactive_map_group_hourly_error.html">Map 3: Parking Accuracy for Each Group</a> – Also represented by the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Use the slider to explore the accuracy across different hours.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- <li><a href="map4.html">Map 4: Multi-modal Transport Analysis</a> – This map visualizes multi-modal transport networks and efficiency across city regions.</li> -->
